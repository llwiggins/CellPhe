## Overview
The CellPhe toolkit comprises three main stages: cell boundary coordinate extraction, feature extraction and selection, and data analysis. These stages are implemented in Matlab, C/C++ and R respectively, and are contained within subdirectories of this repository. For a full description of the methodology encapsulated by this software, please see the companion manuscript.

## How To Use This Toolkit
The setup and usage of each toolkit component is described in the CellPhe Toolkit Manual, found within this repository, as well as in README files found within the repository subdirectories.
